Welcome to Tula: our senior design project! The mobile application can be found in the "REALAPP_Tula" directory.

Project Background: Nearly 3 million people in the US are affected by POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome), a disorder that causes unpredictable fainting due to blood pooling in legs. This number is rapidly growing as post-Covid patients are developing POTS. POTS can prevent the ability to work or study, causing annual lost income in the US of $25 billion. There is currently no effective treatment to prevent POTS attacks. We aim to solve this unmet need through Tula, a smart compression stocking platform that predicts POTS attacks from real-time heart rate monitoring, to personalize compression for venous return of blood and mitigate POTS symptoms for improved quality of life. Tula uses elastic velcro bands for compression and gets real-time compression data from elastic stretch sensors, based on our mathematical model. This is integrated with heart rate sensing from a smartwatch. Upon detecting heart rate spikes, the mobile app alerts the user and guides through personalized compression adjustments. Tula is innovative for the first integration of three components: elastic compression mechanisms, modular electronic sensors, and predictive software. Ultimately, Tula can provide dynamic compression and physiological monitoring to be the first smart clothing solution for POTS and post-Covid patients.
